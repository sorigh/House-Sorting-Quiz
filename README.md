# Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz in C#

This project uses **C#** with **Windows Forms** to implement a **Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz** in **Visual Studio**. The application allows users to answer a series of questions, and based on their answers, they will be sorted into one of the four Hogwarts houses: **Gryffindor**, **Hufflepuff**, **Ravenclaw**, or **Slytherin**.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: The user is prompted with personality questions, and they can select their answers using radio buttons.
- **House Sorting**: Based on the user's answers, they are assigned to one of the four Hogwarts houses at the end of the quiz.
- **Results Display**: After the quiz, the userâ€™s house assignment is displayed with a short description of the house traits.

## Main Form

The main form of the application consists of:

- **Question Labels**: Display the quiz questions.
- **Answer Radio Buttons**: The user selects an answer for each question. The answers correspond to traits associated with the four Hogwarts houses.
- **Submit Button**: The user clicks this button after answering all questions to calculate their house.
- **Result Label**: Displays the name of the user's assigned Hogwarts house after submitting the quiz.

## Logic
- Each answer is associated with a house, and after answering all questions, a scoring system is applied.
- The house with the highest score is assigned to the user.
  

## Customization

- **Questions & Answers**: Modify the .txt file that contains the questions and answers to change the quiz content.
- **Scoring System**: Adjust the scoring logic to fine-tune how house assignment works.
- **UI Design**: Customize the Windows Forms UI, including adding images, changing fonts, or altering button styles.
